# Seedlings
A game by Steven Landow (code), and Trent Brew (art)
This game is only an alpha build. It has very few bugs and
just needs more levels to be created. It is built on libGDX
and takes advantage of features such as shaders (for dynamic
lighting and water refraction) and cross platform capabilities. 

#Story
The gentle Seedlings are a peaceful race. They keep to
themselves in their humble places of dwelling, but
and evil corporation, ECorp, wants to tear down their
home for lumber and to build new factories. One small
seed will need to gather help from his friends to take
the forest back and preserve their natural habitat.
